36M Single by choice because I'm happy being on my own. I was an only child with a very small family and I've been "alone" for a vast majority of my life. It just feels normal to me. I never thought much about it until I was in my mid 20s and realized one day how much of an outlier I actually am. I engage in hobbies, focus on self-care, and spend time with the people in my circle. It's a peaceful life and I love it.

>36M 选择单身，因为我很高兴独自一人。我是一个很小的家庭里的独生子，我一生的大部分时间都是“孤独”的。我觉得这很正常。我从来没有考虑过这个问题，直到我二十多岁的时候，有一天我才意识到我实际上是多么的异类。我从事自己的爱好，专注于自我保健，并花时间与我圈子里的人在一起。这是一种平静的生活，我喜欢它。


This. I’m the same way. 34f and happily single. My mom still tries to set me up, bless her. But I’m very happy alone and don’t feel like anything is missing from my life by being single. I love my freedom.

>这。我也是一样的情况34f，快乐单身。我妈妈仍然试图陷害我，祝福她。但我一个人很开心，并不觉得单身让我的生活失去了任何东西。我热爱我的自由。

Have you ever been pressured to 'settle down and marry' by family or friends?

>您是否曾受到家人或朋友的“安定下来并结婚”的压力？



A little here and there. Tbh most of my close friends are also single, except for 1. Like attracts like I guess haha. I haven't felt a lot of pressure from family, either. Moreso extended family than anything else. The sort of sympathetic "Aw don't worry you'll find someone." I've stopped explaining my position at this point because I don't care enough to expend anymore energy on it lol.

>到处都有一点。老实说，我的大多数亲密朋友也是单身，除了 1。我想物以类聚，哈哈。我也没有感受到来自家人的太大压力。更重要的是大家庭。那种富有同情心的“哦，别担心，你会找到一个人的。”我现在已经停止解释我的立场了，因为我不太关心在这上面花费更多的精力，哈哈。
